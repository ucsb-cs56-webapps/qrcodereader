# QRCODE READER

To use, you need to get firebase credentials in a file called `credentials.json` generated from https://cloud.google.com/iam/. Call you file exactly credentials.json because that is in the .gitignore file. 
Then run setup.sh before you run the program. It will read the credentials from the json file and store in the enviroment variable FIREBASE_JSON.
